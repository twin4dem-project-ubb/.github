# TWIN4DEM - Digital Twins for Democracy

## 🔒 Private Research Repositories

This private repository hosts source code developed by the research staff of
Babeș-Bolyai University of Cluj-Napoca as part of the TWIN4DEM (Digital Twins
for Democracy) project, funded by Horizon Europe.

TWIN4DEM explores how digital technologies—especially digital twins—can
contribute to safeguarding democratic values and institutions.
Our team is building a novel digital twin with the explicit purpose of detecting
early signs of executive aggrandisement in democratic systems. 
Our work is linked with and guided by our close collaboration with other
TWIN4DEM teams that focus on:

* Analyzing how citizens and institutions respond to threats against democracy
* Developing policy recommendations and mitigation strategies using participatory
and inclusive digital models

The code stored here includes experimental tools, early prototypes, and
work-in-progress components. These materials are not intended for public release
in their current form. They may be incomplete, unstable, or contain sensitive
project logic not yet ready for dissemination. This repository is for internal use
only and supports the ongoing interdisciplinary collaboration between political
science, computational social science, AI, law, and philosophy within the TWIN4DEM
project.
